CIS 250

## Overview

This simple application will take a Census data file and parse it into a class. After that, it will give you the option to sort it via a bubble or insertion sort. Once sorted it will display the first ten people in the list, along with the last ten.

## Issues

I didn't run into any issues with the finished project, but I did run into a big issue at the begining. I was having problem trying to figure out how to parse the person string, I didn't want to make static varibles that define a position. I knew a loop was what I wanted to use, so I messed around and figured out what it needed to be.
